Flesh and Blood, Custom Card Creator.

Thank you for looking at my Custom Card Creator (CCC).  
<br>
<h1>**IMPORTANT**<br>
Unfortunately, the way processing exports its sketches is a bit janky, so for the best experience, download **Processing** At: www.processing.org/download, and run it directly from the IDE.  
<br>
Anyway, Usage of the App is simple, nothing is labled, but arent to hard to figure out what does what if you know the card layouts.  
<br>
This app was made with Speed in mind... Have an idea? Open the app and throw it together ASAP so you dont forget.  
Thanks for taking a look, Any feedback is appreciated.
