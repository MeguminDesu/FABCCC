# FABCCC
Flesh and Blood, Custom Card Creator.

Thank you for looking at my Custom Card Creator (CCC).  
<br>
# **IMPORTANT**<br>
Unfortunately, the way processing exports its sketches is a bit janky, so for the best experience, download **Processing** At: www.processing.org/download, and run it directly from the IDE.  
Follow these stepd for ease:
1. Download Processing
2. Download FAB_CCC
3. Ensure all files of "FAB_CCC" are in a folder specifically called: "FAB_CCC", (Processing will not open it otherwise)
4. Open "FAB_CCC.pde"
5. Click the Play button in the top left
6. Enjoy
7. Optional: Look at the code for cool points <3 :)
<br>
Anyway, Usage of the App is simple, nothing is labled, but arent to hard to figure out what does what if you know the card layouts.  
<br>
This app was made with Speed in mind... Have an idea? Open the app and throw it together ASAP so you dont forget.  
Thanks for taking a look, Any feedback is appreciated.
